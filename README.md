These notebooks use SageMath to integrate null geodesics in a Hartle-Thorne spacetime and produce Poincare maps and Shadows. 

They accompany the paper "Chaotic photon orbits and shadows of a non-Kerr object described by the Hartle-Thorne spacetime" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09367) and give a demonstration of the calculations present in the paper.
